# Rent & Play Toys

This is my General Assembly final project, I've built a page to rent toys. 
Rent and Play Toys is an idea inspired in my loved nephew Vinicius who is overseas , because sometimes I would love to give him all cool toys he deserves.

But sometimes it isn't possible because some toys are very expensive and I, his mom and you for sure know that usually kids lose they interest in one specific toy really fast and just move on for another toy. 

So the main idea of my page is to make some toys more accessible for those who wants to make they little ones happy, playing with an cool toy even for a short period of time.

Rent & Play Toy has a variety of toys that usually are more expensive, most offer more than one use option providing more fun.

## :bookmark_tabs: About

The main idea of this page is to make some toys more accessible.

Rent and Play Toys provides a lot toys categories, such as educational, activities and outside.

In the main page the user seen all toys available and unavailable, by clicking on toy it will show toy details: product description, category, recommended age to play, and items included.

To rent a toy users have to login or sign up, and after select any toy it will show days of rent options, after click on rent button the toy becomes unavailable, users can see their rent history and return a rented toy. 
This is a full stack project, I'm using Strapi for back end content management and React and Javascript for my front end.
